# Settings are things that don't change very often. They are passed directly
# to the TransectContainer object, and all of the Containers it contains, so
# you have access to them everywhere. These items are available as follows:
#    tc.settings['domain']
# etc. The dictionary is an OrderedDict, so order is preserved everywhere.
